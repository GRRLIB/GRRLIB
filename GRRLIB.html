Introduction
------------

GRRLIB is a C/C++ 2D Graphics library for Wii application developers.  It is
essentially a wrapper which presents a friendly interface to the Nintendo GX
core.

As of v4.10., GRRLIB is supplied as a standard C/C++ library (aka. archive)
called 'libgrrlib'.  Because GRRLIB processes JPEG and PNG images, it requires
the installation of the 'libjpeg' and 'libpngu' libraries.  'libpngu', in turn,
requires 'libpng' and 'libpng' requires 'libz'.

libgrrlib          <- 2D graphics library
+-- libjpeg        <- JPEG image processor
+-- libpngu        <- Wii wrapper for libpng
    +-- libpng     <- PNG image processor
        +-- libz   <- Zip (lossless) compsression (for PNG compression)


Developing for the Wii
----------------------

Do not progress until you have installed and configured devkitPro.  Guides are
and assistance are available at http://forums.devkitpro.org

If you have just performed a clean (re)install on your Windows PC, be sure to
reboot before you continue.


Downloading GRRLIB
------------------

You are advised to use "the latest SVN trunk version" of GRRLIB at all times.
There is a simple guide to "Using SVN" here:
http://grrlib.santo.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?id=182

This document will presume that you have downloaded "the latest SVN trunk
version" to a directory called  C:\grr\trunk

Installing GRRLIB
-----------------

This guide is for Windows.  If you are using Linux, I am going to presume you
are smart enough to convert these instructions.

GRRLIB  is supplied as source code.
libjpeg is supplied as a precompiled library.*
libpngu is supplied as source code
libpng  is supplied as a precompiled library
libz    is supplied with devkitpro (Ie. preinstalled)

*The version of libjpeg supplied with GRRLIB v4.1.0 contains bug fixes not
available in the official release.  If you can track down the original author,
please tell him about these fixes.

Because of the way dependancies work, the libraries must be installed in reverse
order.

libz comes preinstalled with devkitPro, so we can move directly to libpng...

To install libpng
  c:
  cd \grr\trunk\GRRLIB\lib\png
  make install

Next up the list is libpngu
  c:
  cd \grr\trunk\GRRLIB\lib\pngu
  make clean
  make all
  make install

Next up the list is libjpeg*
  c:
  cd \grr\trunk\GRRLIB\lib\jpeg
  make install

*The version of libjpeg supplied with GRRLIB v4.1.0 contains bug fixes not
 available in the official release.

Finally, we can now install libgrrlib
  c:
  cd \grr\trunk\GRRLIB\GRRLIB
  make clean
  make all
  make install


Using GRRLIB
------------

After everything is installed, simply put
    #include <grrlib.h>
at the top of your .c file and use the functions as required

You will also need to add
    -lgrrlib -ljpeg -lpngu -lpng -lz
to the libs line in your makefile
...Remember the order of the libraries is critical.  You may (need to) insert
other libraries in the middle of the list, you may need to add others to the
start, or even the end - but do _not_ change the order of the libraries shown
here.

You do NOT need to placce /anything/ in your application directory.

If you would like to see a working example of this, you can look at the example
found in: C:\grr\trunk\examples\bluechip\composition
...This example also includes a "Makefile" which tries to make it clear what is
happening (unlike the more comprehensive cross-platform Makefile supplied with
the devkitPro template application).


Error: guVector redefined
-------------------------

If you get this error, you are probably using a version of libogc more recent
than the released v1.7.1a.

In the libogc SVN revision 3650 Vector was renamed to guVector "to avoid
collisions"  ...also Quaternion was renamed to guQuaternion - but GRRLIB does
not use these!

The main codebase of GRRLIB has been updated to reflect this change.
But until the new libogc is officially released, if you are using a version of
libogc later than v1.7.1a/svn3649, you will need to add:
  -DNOGUFIX
to the compiler flags (CFLAGS) in your makefile

When the libogc changes are officially released, this *temporary fix* should be
removed [see grrlib.h, line 50ish]
The requirement for -DNOGUFIX will be deprecated, but its lingering presence
will not be a hinderance

Thanks to Nicksasa for reporting this problem
